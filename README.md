Docker is a tool that makes it easier to create, deploy and run applications. It uses containers to package an application along with its dependencies and then runs the application in an isolated virtualised environment.

Configuring a Docker container environment may become complex and tedious. Kedro-Docker significantly simplifies this process and reduces it to 2 steps:

1. Build a Docker image
2. Run your [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro) project in a Docker environment

> *Note:* Kedro-Docker also makes it easy for you to run IPython and Jupyter Notebooks in a Docker container.

## How do I install Kedro-Docker?

Kedro-Docker is a Python plugin. To install it:

```bash
pip install kedro-docker
```

## How do I use Kedro-Docker?

### Prerequisites
The following conditions must be true for Kedro-Docker to package your project:

* Make sure you have [installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/) Docker
* Kedro-Docker assumes that [Docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/) is up and running in your system

### Build a Docker image

In order to build a Docker image for your project, navigate to the project's root directory and then run the following from the command line:

```bash
kedro docker build
```

Behind the scenes Kedro does the following:

1. Creates a template `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` in the project root directory if those files don't already exist
2. Builds the project image using the `Dockerfile` from the project root directory

> *Note:* When calling `kedro docker build` you can also pass any specific options for `docker build` by specifying `--docker-args` option. For example, `kedro docker build --docker-args="--no-cache"` instructs Docker not to use cache when building the image. You can learn more about available options [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/).

By default, the project Docker image will be tagged as `<project-root-dir>:latest`, where `<project-root-dir>` is the name of the project root directory. To change the tag, you can add the `--image` command line option, for example: `kedro docker build --image my-project-tag`.

When building the image Kedro copies the contents of the current project into the image, however it ignores the locations specified in `.dockerignore` file in order to prevent the propagation of potentially sensitive data into the image. We recommend mounting those volumes at runtime.

Options:
* `--uid` - optional integer User ID for kedro user inside the container. Defaults to the current user's UID
* `--gid` - optional integer Group ID for kedro user inside the container. Defaults to the current user's GID
* `--image` - optional Docker image tag. Defaults to the project directory name
* `--docker-args` - optional string containing extra options for `docker build` command
* `-h, --help` - show command help an exit.

### Run your project in a Docker environment

Once the project image has been built, you can run the project using a Docker environment:

```bash
kedro docker run
```

The command above will:
1. Locate the image built in the previous section
2. Copy the whole project directory into the `/home/kedro` container path
3. Execute `kedro run` command in a new container

> *Note:* The `kedro docker run` command adds `--rm` flag to the underlying `docker run` call, therefore the container will be automatically removed when it exits. Please make sure that you persist all necessary data outside the container at runtime to avoid data loss.

By default `kedro docker run` will use an image tagged as `<project-root-dir>:latest` to create a container. If you renamed your image in the previous step, please also provide an `--image` option with the corresponding image tag, for example: `kedro docker run --image "my-custom-image:latest"`.

When calling `kedro docker run` you can also pass any specific options for `docker run` by providing `--docker-args` option. Since `--docker-args` may contain multiple arguments, it's a good idea to add quotation marks. For example, `kedro docker run --docker-args="--env KEY=MYVALUE"` instructs Docker to set environment variable `KEY` to `MYVALUE` in the container. You can learn more about available options [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/).

All other CLI options will be appended to `kedro run` command inside the container. For example, `kedro docker run --parallel` will run `kedro run --parallel` inside the container.

Options:
* `--image` - Docker image name to be used, defaults to project root directory name
* `--docker-args` - optional string containing extra options for `docker run` command
* `-h, --help` - show command help an exit
* Any other options will be treated as `kedro run` command options

### Interactive development with Docker

In addition to `kedro docker run` Kedro also supports the following commands:

* `kedro docker ipython` - Run IPython session inside the container
* `kedro docker jupyter notebook` - Start a Jupyter Notebook inside the container
* `kedro docker jupyter lab` - Start a Jupyter Lab inside the container

Options:
* `--image` - Docker image name to be used, defaults to project root directory name
* `--docker-args` - optional string containing extra options for `docker run` command
* `--port` - host port that a container's port will be mapped to, defaults to 8888. This option applies to `kedro docker jupyter` commands only
* `-h, --help` - show command help an exit
* Any other options will be treated as corresponding `kedro` command CLI options. For example, `kedro docker jupyter lab --NotebookApp.token='' --NotebookApp.password=''` will run Jupyter Lab server without the password and token.

> *Important:* Please note that source code directory of a project (`src` folder) is *not* mounted to the Docker container by default. This means that if you change any code in `src` directory inside the container, those changes will *not* be saved to the host machine and will be completely lost when the container is terminated. In order to mount the whole project when running a Jupyter Lab, for example, run the following command:

```bash
kedro docker jupyter lab --docker-args "-v ${PWD}:/home/kedro"
```

### Running custom commands with Docker

You can also run an arbitrary command inside Docker container by executing `kedro docker cmd <CMD>`, where `<CMD>` corresponds to the command that you want to execute. If `<CMD>` is not specified, this will execute `kedro run` inside the container.

> *Note:* If you are running `kedro` command, unlike in the previous sections, you should specify the whole command including `kedro` keyword. This is to allow the execution of non Kedro commands as well.

For example:

1. `kedro docker cmd kedro test` will run `kedro test` inside the container
2. `kedro docker cmd` will run `kedro run` inside the container
3. `kedro docker cmd --docker-args="-it" /bin/bash` will create an interactive `bash` shell in the container (and allocate a pseudo-TTY connected to the containerâ€™s stdin). 

Options:
* `--image` - Docker image name to be used, defaults to project root directory name
* `--docker-args` - optional string containing extra options for `docker run` command
* `-h, --help` - show command help an exit.
